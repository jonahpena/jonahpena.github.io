## Who I Am

I'm a passionate software developer who loves technology, problem-solving, and getting outside! I graduated from Texas A&M with a major in business and a minor in cybersecurity. Although I started my career in sales, working as an account manager at Apex Systems (a tech staffing and consulting firm), I immediately knew I would find a career for myself somewhere in the SDLC.

My first client was the Director of UX at Thomson Reuters. We spent hours over lunch learning all about UX and their role in the SDLC. As I learned more about the field, I became fascinated with the world of software development and practiced in my free-time. After transitioning to a role with Thomson Reuters and receiving mentorship from members of their development team, I decided to take the leap into technology by completing a full-stack boot camp with TEKsystems. Here I strengthened my skills in React.js, JavaScript, C#, .NET, and Java.

Despite finding front-end development relatively easy, I faced challenges in back-end development. I leaned into this area, determined to become proficient in back-end technologies. I earned my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, SAFe 5 Practitioner Certification, and worked on a few internal projects using C# during my time with TEKSystems. To keep my front end skills strong, I always implement a UI in my personal projects and volunteer as a mentor in an afterschool program assisting youth with their JavaScript coursework.

As a lifelong learner and avid explorer, I enjoy cycling, mountain biking, golf, bowling, video games, board games, and anything that gets me out of the house!

## Long-Term Goals and Aspirations

Once I have enough experience, I'd love to pursue a role as a leader in the software development field. I'm laid-back, flexible, and easy to work with, but extremely ambitious and hardworking.

My love for finding solutions and solving problems drives my passion for software development. I look forward to continuing to learn, grow, and make a positive impact on the world through technology.
