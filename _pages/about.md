Hello! I'm a passionate software developer with a background in business and cybersecurity from Texas A&M University. Having transitioned from sales into the world of software development, I've found my true calling in solving problems through technology.

### Skills and Experience:

- Proficient in React.js, JavaScript, C#, .NET, and Java
- AWS Cloud Practitioner Certified
- Microsoft Azure project experience
- JavaScript Mentor for grades 3-8 through the "Bold Idea" after-school program
- Successfully completed full-stack boot camp with TEKsystems.
- Bachelors in Business Management
- Minor in CyberSecurity

### Career Journey
My career began in sales at Apex Systems, a tech staffing and consulting firm. However, as I began building relationships in the tech field, I quickly realized my passion lay within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I had the opportunity to learn about UX and its role in the SDLC from my first client, the Director of UX at Thomson Reuters. This experience put me on a path to pursue software development. I later received mentorship from the director of their development team, which led me to complete a full-stack boot camp with TEKsystems and fully transition into technology.

### Personal Interests
Outside of my professional life, I'm an avid explorer and enjoy activities such as mountain biking, golf, bowling, video games, and board games.

### Future Aspirations
As I continue to grow in this field, my goal is to leverage my skills and experience to take on a leadership role in software development. I am driven by my love for finding solutions and solving problems, and I am excited about the prospect of making a positive impact through technology.
